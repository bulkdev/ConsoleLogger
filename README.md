ConsoleLogger
=============

Description:
Log player's issued commands in console
Record player's last issued command in saves.yml

Purpose
=============

If you know Bukkit, you'll know that Bukkit server's console will log player's issued commands in the console.
Now, I made it for PocketMine!

In console
=============

For example: hoyinm issued the login command (imagine that the server is using SimpleAuth)
then...
Console: <server> hoyinm issued server command /login 123456
(You can even see the player's password XD)

Commands
=============

/consolelogger  -  show credits of the plugin

TODO
=============

(I'm still thinking XD)
